# Hi, I'm Jackson 👋🏾

<img src="makinda-git.jpg" alt="banner that says Makinda Jackson - artist, designer and code lover">
I'm a ( progressive ) frontend developer ✌🏾 specializing in designing and building cool websites.
<br>
As a designer 🧑🏾‍🎨, bridging between design ( graphics and interface features ) and development by combining my technical knowledge to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always create & build cool-digital staffs that solve problems.

Some technologies I'm working with 👌🏾 on Bootstrap, Bulma and ReactJS, recently learning Laravel ( The PHP Framework for Web Artisans ).

Without computer with me, I'm probably reading 📙, exploring places 🌍, watching movies 🎞️ or listerning musics 🎧.
